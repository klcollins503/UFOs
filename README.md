# UFOs

## Overview
Javascript excercise to showcase abilities at creating a dynamic website.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a visually stunning webpage and display a table of data from a javascript file. There are multiple input options for filtering the table, which showcase my ability at javascript functions and d3.

## Results
#### Creating a UFO sightings tracker
This website displays a table of data from a javascript file. It accepts user inputs to filter the table on one or more criteria.
The filter boxes on the left pane of the website accept user input on one or more criteria. 

The image below shows a single date criteria:

The next image shows multiple criteria, date and city:

One suggestion for further development on this website would be a keyword search from the comment section. With a keyword search someone could input words like "hoax" or "loud" and see the results.

One drawback to this website design is that the filter boxes are easy to reset. Once a filter is set up it can accidentally be removed by the user. This could be fixed by having the filter results open a new tab and have a page of the filter results.
